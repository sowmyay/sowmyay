### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer focusing on data-centric problem solving. 

I currently work at [rideOS](https://rideos.ai/) where I am focusing on building ETA (estimated time of arrival) improvement models.

In my spare time, I like to work on personal projects and also contribute to the open source community
